Operation:A travel agency's main function is to act as an agent, selling travel products and services on behalf of a supplier. 
Consequently, unlike other retail businesses, they do not keep a stock in hand, unless they have pre-booked hotel rooms and/or
 cabins on a cruise ship for a group travel event such as a wedding, honeymoon, or a group event. 
 A package holiday or a ticket is not purchased from a supplier unless a customer requests that purchase. 
 The holiday or ticket is supplied to the agency at a discount. The profit is therefore the difference between the 
 advertised price which the customer pays and the discounted price at which it is supplied to the agent. 
 This is known as the commission. In many countries, all individuals or companies that sell tickets are required 
 to be licensed as a travel agent.</p>
